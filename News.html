<p style="font-size: 22px;">The Digital Skills Centre on the 5th floor of the College was created following a total refurbishment of the existing IT and Computing facilities.</p> <p style="font-size: 22px;">The work on the centre began at the start of summer 2018 and was completed in time for students to begin using the facilities on the first day of the new 2018-2019 Academic year.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">The Â£1 million state-of-the-art facility was supported by the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership and Midlands Engine, and was built to replicate a professional,</p> <p style="font-size: 22px;">working agency environment, kitted out with the latest smart technology showcasing cyber security, data modelling programming and virtual simulation software.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px">The official opening of The Digital Skills Centre took place on 31st January 2019 when local employers, Councillors and Governors joined College staff and students to celebrate the cutting-edge refurbishment that had been undertaken.</p>  <p style="font-size: 22px;">IT and Business students studying at the College have already been lucky enough to access the centre, which opened in September, but the official opening marks the publication of the training opportunities also available to businesses in the form of CISCO, Microsoft and digital apprenticeship courses.<p>

<p style="font-size: 22px">The Digital Skills Centre offers a fantastic space for students to learn and work. The available space offers students up to date computer workstations and Google Chromebooks to work with.</p>  <p style="font-size: 22px;">Ergonomically designed seating and tables allows students to sit comfortably, discuss ideas and learn in a collaborative way. The level of equipment provided is second to none and this future proofing means students are always ready for the digital world they will be entering into.</p>
